In my [previous blog post](https://unikraft.org/blog/2024-06-17-gsoc-multiboot2), I outlined a general strategy for software enhancement, focusing on the first steps of the project: understanding the Multiboot2 protocol and preparing the development environment.
Naturally, over the following three weeks, I progressed to the next stages: implementing the necessary changes/additions and then testing the code.

## Structuring for Seamless Integration

In order to have Multiboot2 integrated in Unikraft, I mirrored the existing file organization established for Multiboot and extended it to accommodate the new protocol.
Three core files handle the protocol itself, while the rest of the codebase is updated around them to ensure proper integration and functionality.
Let's take a closer look:

### `multiboot.S`

This assembly file plays a pivotal role in preparing a standardized operating environment.
It verifies the system is booted through a compliant Multiboot/Multiboot2 bootloader and manages essential memory relocations.
In this context, the only modifications required were replacing `multiboot.h` and `MULTIBOOT_BOOTLOADER_MAGIC` with their Multiboot2 counterparts, featured depending on the chosen configurations.

### `multiboot2.py`

The Python script generates and adds the Multiboot2 and updated ELF headers to the original ELF file.
This ensures that the bootloader information is strategically positioned at the start, facilitating correct system initialization.
Since the Multiboot protocol is limited to 32-bit systems, the `multiboot.py` script also required transforming 64-bit ELFs into 32-bit ones.
This is no longer the case when it comes to Multiboot2, only needing to incorporate the Multiboot2 and updated ELF headers into the file, without any other alterations.

### `multiboot2.c`

This C program is responsible for processing boot information from a Multiboot2-compliant bootloader.
It meticulously manages memory regions, integrates boot parameters, and prepares the system for kernel execution by consolidating memory configurations and allocating essential resources.

Alongside these core files, I made adjustments to adjacent files to seamlessly link everything together and ensure successful booting under Multiboot2 (e.g. duplicating the `mkukimg` script's menuentry to use `multiboot2` instead of `multiboot` etc.).

## Testing the Waters: Progress and Challenges

My initial focus was to lay the groundwork by creating the `multiboot.S` and `multiboot2.py` files and testing them with the simple `helloworld` application.
This allowed me to verify that the Multiboot2 header was inserted correctly and the system could boot without major hiccups.

Of course, debugging became my constant companion during this process.
Tools like `hexdump` and attaching `gdb` to my custom GRUB build proved invaluable.

I encountered an initial hurdle regarding the ELF file.
After playing around with GRUB error messages and making a "comparative study" of the binaries with Multiboot, Multiboot2, or no additional header, I realized the ELF was lacking the Multiboot2 header altogether.
Some detective work later, I traced the issue to an unlinked `multiboot2.py` script.

## Multiboot2 Header: A Deep Dive

So far, I really emphasized the need of the Multiboot2 header.
But what is its role?

The Multiboot2 header is a structured data block embedded within the bootable system image.
Its purpose is to facilitate the transition of control and information from the bootloader to the kernel during the boot process.
This header acts as a standardized communication channel, ensuring the kernel can access essential details about the system's hardware, memory layout, and other boot-related parameters.

### Format and Contents

The Multiboot2 header follows a specific format, starting with a fixed-size header followed by a series of variable-length tags.

The fixed-size header includes:

- The magic number `0xE85250D6` indicating a Multiboot2-compliant image
- The target architecture  (e.g. `i386`, `x86_64`)
- The header length, including all tags
- The checksum of the header, used for error detection

I talked a little about the tags in my previous blog post, but to recap, they provide detailed information about the system's memory layout, boot command line, and other essential parameters.
Commonly, each tag has a type, size and payload.
There is a multitude of tags to choose from, depending on the specific requirements of the system, adding to the flexibility of Multiboot2.

In the context of this project, it may be valuable to note that simply adding the Multiboot2 header to the ELF file is not sufficient.
On top of that, both `multiboot.py` and `multiboot2.py` scripts add an extra ELF header with updated offsets, "sandwiching" the Multiboot2 header between it and the original ELF.
To better visualize this, we can refer to the following diagram:

```text
          ┌────────────────────┐
  ┌───────│ Updated EHDR       |─────────────┐
  |       ├────────────────────┤             |
  └──────>| Updated PHDR       |             |
          ├────────────────────┤             |
          | MB2HDR             |             |
          ├────────────────────┤             |  
  ┌───────| Original EHDR      |────────┐    |
  |       ├────────────────────┤        |    |
  └──────>| Original PHDR      |        |    |
          ├────────────────────┤        |    |
          | Original SHDR      |<───────┘    |
          ├────────────────────┤             |
          | ...                |             |
          ├────────────────────┤             |
          | Updated SHDR       |<────────────┘
          └────────────────────┘
```

This ensures that GRUB identifies the overall file as an ELF and avoids any potential complications along the way.

### Interaction between Bootloader and Kernel

The bootloader locates the Multiboot2 header within the ELF file.
After verifying the magic number and architecture compatibility, it parses the header and tags.
Next, the information requested by the tags is placed into the kernel memory and the bootloader passes control to the kernel.

The kernel, in turn, accesses the Multiboot2 header using the information provided by the bootloader.
It iterates through the tags to extract the necessary data, such as memory regions, boot command line, and other parameters.
This information is used to initialize its own data structures, set up memory management, and configure the system for execution.

## Next Steps

With the Multiboot2 header issue resolved, the ELF file is now generated correctly.
However, the system still encounters a roadblock, getting stuck in what appears to be an infinite loop.
More debugging using `gdb` for me it is!

After I pinpoint and fix the problem, I will move on to:

- Refactoring `multiboot2.py` to handle tag inclusion more generically
- Implementing the `multiboot2.c` file
- Testing the new modifications once again
