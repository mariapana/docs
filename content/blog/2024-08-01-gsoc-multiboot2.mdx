Recalling my [previous blog post](https://unikraft.org/blog/2024-07-10-gsoc-multiboot2):

> With the Multiboot2 header issue resolved, the ELF file is now generated correctly.

Boy, was I wrong!
The past three weeks have been a rollercoaster of debugging, testing, and more debugging.
That being said, considerable progress has been made, which will be the focus of this update post.

## The Debugging Chronicles

In reviewing the issues with the infinite loop, I realized that the root cause was the omission of the end tag in the Multiboot2 header.
Multiboot2 headers require a specific ending structure to signal the completion of the header sequence.
Without this tag, the bootloader, GRUB in this case, continues to search for it indefinitely, leading to the infinite loop.
Now that the issue was resolved, a new contender emerged: the "out of memory" error.
Let the games begin!

### The "Out of Memory" Error

The "out of memory" error was a puzzling one.
The first instinct was to increase the memory size, but no matter how much memory was allocated, the error persisted.
This meant that either something was null or the area where the memory was being allocated was already populated due to possible fragmentation.

Since the error was occuring in the [`grub_relocator_alloc_chunk_align`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/grub-core/lib/relocator.c#L1371) function, I decided to find its caller to reconstitute the flow and logic leading here.
There were several difficulties with debugging this.

Firstly, I was connected to a 64-bit `gdb` server, but the error was occurring in 32-bit mode so the registers were all messed up.
To make life a bit easier, I ended up using `qemu-system-i386` instead of `qemu-system-x86_64`.
Sure, I couldn't boot Unikraft like this, but I could at least debug the issue at hand.

Additionally, I had no symbols.
Therefore, I had to load them manually using `add-symbol-file` in `gdb` for each module I was interested in.

It is important to mention what I mean by "module".
GRUB has an interesting way of organizing its modules and object files.
This might be misleading, since the extensions are `.mod` and `.module`.
In short, `.mod` files are the final binary that will be loaded at boot time, while `.module`s are intermediate unstripped object files that contains symbol and debug information.
For the purpose of debugging, I needed the `.module` files.

Obviously, the first module I looked into was `relocator.module`.
I then needed to determine the base address where I had added my breakpoint.
The plan was to:

- print the address of the function using [`__builtin_return_address(0)`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Return-Address.html#index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005freturn_005faddress)
- object dump the module to find the offset of the function
- get the base address by substracting the offset from the address

Pretty straightforward, right?
Normally, yes.
But here?
Well, not quite.
After performing this process with the printed address, `gdb` was showing code from [`malloc_in_range`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/grub-core/lib/relocator.c#L416) instead of [`grub_relocator_alloc_chunk_align`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/grub-core/lib/relocator.c#L1371).
Additionally, it did not match the assembly, which corresponded to the manual breakpoint I had added: a dummy volatile integer set to zero and an infinite loop waiting for a change in value (once in `gdb`, I set the register value to 1 to break the loop).

```c
volatile int dummy_var = 0;
while (!dummy_var);
```

This was peculiar to say the least.
So, without much hope of anything changing, I tried the address of the line I was currently on and, lo and behold, it worked!

I could finally backtrace and see the flow of the code, which also solved the mystery of why the previous attempt failed in the first place.
The address printed by [`__builtin_return_address(0)`](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Return-Address.html#index-_005f_005fbuiltin_005freturn_005faddress) was that of a wrapper function which called [`grub_relocator_alloc_chunk_align`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/grub-core/lib/relocator.c#L1371).
[`grub_relocator_alloc_chunk_align_safe`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/include/grub/relocator.h#L60) is defined in [`/include/grub/relocator.h`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/include/grub/relocator.h).
Therefore, the printed address was correct, since I was in fact in the `_safe` counterpart.
And normally, had it not been because of the definition in a header file, the address would have matched.
But after the preprocessor replaced the call with the definition including [`grub_relocator_alloc_chunk_align`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/grub-core/lib/relocator.c#L1371), the address no longer matched.

The backtrace also revealed the culprit for the "out of memory" error: the [`grub_relocator32_boot`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/grub/grub-2.06/source/grub-core/lib/i386/relocator.c#L75) function had been called earlier with a null relocator.
To see when the relocator changed to null, I set a watchpoint, which quickly indicated the obstacle and allowed for an easy fix.

Drumrolls, please!
Ladies and gentlemen, we successfully booted into Unikraft! ðŸŽ‰

## Monkey see, Monkey do

Now that GRUB collected the necessary information in the form of the `mbi`, it is time to pass it to Unikraft.
This is done by calling the [`multiboot2_entry`](https://github.com/mariapana/unikraft/blob/multiboot2/plat/kvm/x86/multiboot2.c#L162) function, which is defined in `multiboot2.c`.

The [`multiboot2_entry`](https://github.com/mariapana/unikraft/blob/multiboot2/plat/kvm/x86/multiboot2.c#L162) function is responsible for processing the Multiboot2 information and setting up the system for the kernel.
This involves parsing the tags and setting up the memory regions, boot command line, and other essential parameters.

The focus now shifts to implementing the `multiboot2.c` file and testing the new modifications.
Considering Unikraft's ecosystem, the function handles three tags: `MULTIBOOT_TAG_TYPE_CMDLINE`, `MULTIBOOT_TAG_TYPE_MODULE` (mainly for `initrd`), and `MULTIBOOT_TAG_TYPE_MMAP`.

## Next Steps

Now being able to boot into Unikraft, I aim to refine how each scenario for the tags is implemented in order to have a functional `helloworld` application.
Until then, stay tuned for the next update!
